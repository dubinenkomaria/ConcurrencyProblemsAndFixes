# ConcurrencyProblemsAndFixes

All the concurrency issues and their fixes are provided in MoneyTransferTest file.
Each test has it's own runnables with some changes that describe specific problem or fix.

So fat tests testRaceConditionFixWithMutex() and testFixVisibilityProblemWithVolatile() don't work as expexcted.
While I try to figure out why that happens, feel free to investigate it as well
